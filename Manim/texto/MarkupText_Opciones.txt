PangoMarkup can also contain XML features such as numeric character entities such as &#169; for © can be used too.

<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> and <b><i>bold+italic</i></b>

<ul>underline</ul> and <s>strike through</s>

<tt>typewriter font</tt>

<big>bigger font</big> and <small>smaller font</small>

<sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub>

<span underline="double" underline_color="green">double underline</span>

<span underline="error">error underline</span>

<span overline="single" overline_color="green">overline</span>

<span strikethrough="true" strikethrough_color="red">strikethrough</span>

<span font_family="sans">temporary change of font</span>

<span foreground="red">temporary change of color</span>

<span fgcolor="red">temporary change of color</span>

<gradient from="YELLOW" to="RED">temporary gradient</gradient>
